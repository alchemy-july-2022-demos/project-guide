# Group dynamics

## Collaborating Contributors vs Battling Experts
- Group dynamics are probably the most challenging aspect of a group project. Every unsuccessful project I can think of started with unsuccessful team dynamics. 
- Given the choice, consider which group most you would rather work with:
    1) a group of beginning coders who are good listeners, emapthetic and entusiastic teammates with "strong opinions, loosely held" and who want to have fun building something and learning.
    2) a group of programming experts who are committed to getting their way, obsessed with outcomes, and oblivious to the way their attitude affects their team
- Group 2 is incredibly painful. You will be walking on eggshells all week and we can feel the tension immediately when we visit. This is a miserable week emotionally, and ironically, the project quality will suffer compared to Group 1 because of group paralysis. 

## Expectations and Boundaries
- When selecting a group, be curious about the amount of 'extra' work you're wanting to put into the project. Obviously, you're required to work on the project from 9-6 during sprint week, but some groups work outside these hours as well. Are you in a group like this? Do you _want_ to be in such a group? Set these expectations ahead of time.
- No 'cowboy coding'
    - "If you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together."
    - "Slow is smooth, smooth is fast"

## Common conflicts
- Look at yourself and your group and be conscious about how some people have historically been excluded from the benefits of tech work--specificially, women, people of color, and LGBTQ+ people. 
- Ask as a group: what are you going to do to make sure you don't reproduce that exclusion in your own sprint week group?
- Specifically, the most common complaint we hear: womens' opinions and contributions are ignored, devalued, or disregarded by men in their group.
    - Note that men in this kind of group _don't always notice that there's even a problem_. After all, if you're feeling this way, it is difficult and risky to bring your feelings to your group. It is often easier to just swallow your feelings and endure an unhappy week.
    - This dynamic creates bad feelings (for all parties) that can last for the rest of the cohort. You'll want to be able to depend on your cohort-mates for easy job referrals throughout your career: don't burn this bridge.
- One strategy for preventing this kind of dynamic is to plan daily (maybe twice-daily) check-ins where you do not even talk about code. It might be worthwhile to set a timer and give everyone a minimum of 1 minute uninterrupted time to speak. This is a good idea even if everybody chooses fill that time with silence.
- What if during a check-in, somebody (specifically, a person from a marginalized group) remarks that they are feeling disregarded or devaluded as a team member? 
    1) Resist defensiveness. 
    2) Thank this team member for doing the hard work of bringing up the problem: after all, they want a better group dynamic, and a better group dynamic helps everybody.
    3) Ask: what can we as a team--and I personally--do to repair this situation?
